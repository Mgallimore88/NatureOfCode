above example from 6_7_group steering behaviours

Exploration of programming techniques through simulation of physical systems.

Uses the processing foundation's .p5 library and runs in Python3. 

Original course examples written in  Javascript - I have converted the examples into Python with an object oriented approach to avoid the ugly use of global variables - a necessity for sharing variables between p5's setup and draw functions.  

Course contents indicated by folder names.

To run this code, clone this repo or download an example folder, then type 
python3 main.py
into a terminal from within the folder.
You'll need to install p5, numpy and vispy libraries. 
If you're using Anaconda as your environment manager you can clone the environment using the command 
conda env create -f environment.yml

This repo is first and foremost a place for me to learn to code - please feel free to contribute any improvements or point out bad habits, and let me know if you'd like to work on a project with me.
