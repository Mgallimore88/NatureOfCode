Project from example 6.4 in the nature of code series. 
Autonomous agents are acted on by a force corresponding to a flow field
underlying the sketch area.
The flow field changes over time generated by 3d perlin noise.

This code uses the p5 library with numpy and vispy.
use pip install p5, numpy, vispy 
or
use conda to create the environment from environment.yaml

controls:
hold a key to see the flow field.
