<h1 >Particle System Forces </h1>

The particles come from one source which has a limited lifespan. 

'Dead' particles and sources are managed and removed from memory when no longer needed.

The particles have mass, which affects their inertia.

The yellow object is a repeller with a repulsive force proportional to 1/r squared.

The square particles change their mass on hitting the left or right walls.

A global force can be applied by clicking the mouse 
The strength and direction of the global force is proportonal to the vector from mouse to centre.
