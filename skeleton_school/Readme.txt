This directory is a space for templates of classes used for this NOC repository.
I noticed that since each example builds on the prevous, my classes were becoming very long.
In the interest of code readability I will condense the classes used for each example to include only the code used by that example, whilst maintaining a few skeleton classes in this directory.
