Repository for Mike's Nature Of Code projects.

Original video series written in  Javascript - I have converted the examples into Python which has worked for the most part, but some files have ugly use of global variables to ensure variables are visible to p5's setup and draw functions. This issue is improved using objects in later examples. 

Uses the processing foundation's .p5 library and runs in Python3.

Course contents indicated by folder names, mostly an exploration of programming techniques through simulation of physical systems.

This repo is first and foremost a place for me to learn to code - please feel free to contribute any improvements or point out bad habits, and let me know if you'd like to work on a project with me.
